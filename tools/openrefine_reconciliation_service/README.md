# OpenRefine Reconciliation Service

This is an OpenRefine Reconciliation Service for ancient Roman consulates. Roman consulates usually consisted of two Roman officials whose names you can query. 

Roman dates were customarily kept according to the names of the two consuls who took office that year, much like a regnal year in a monarchy. For instance, the year 59 BC in the Julian calendar was called by the Romans "the consulship of Caesar and Bibulus", since the two colleagues in the consulship were Gaius Julius Caesar and Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul). 

Code is based on https://github.com/OpenRefine/reconciliation_service_skeleton, but has been updated to Python 3, ordering of results by score has been added.
